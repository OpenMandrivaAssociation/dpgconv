Here is a very short documentation to help you with starting using dpgconv

What is dpgconv:
dpgconv can convert videos to DPG format in one run (not only one at time).
Source videos can be anything supported by mplayer/mencoder including 
files, DVDs, VCDs ...
You can hardcode subtitles in the videos.
You can specify video and audio bitrates, but remember you are limited by 
what the NDS/NDSi and DPG formats can handle : only one audio track, and a 
video bitrate low enough to allow the game console to display it.


Options:
The full list of options can be obtained using : dpgconv -h


An example:
How to convert a video dvd, using high quality encoding, 25fps, 320kbps 
for the video, the second audio track, the same aspect as the original, and 
normalized volume :

1) Find the right audio track:
mplayer -vo null -ao null -identify -frames 1 dvd:////dev/dvd | grep ID_AID

2) Convert with:
dpgconv.py -q -f 25 -v 320 --aid 129 --keep-aspect --volnorm dvd:////dev/dvd

This will result in a dvd.dpg file in the current directory (without the 
device name, you would have an hidden ".dpg" file) to copy to your moonshell 
SD card.


A few advises:
* don't mess with -2 option
* default format is now DPG4, so don't forget to change it if you use 
 moonshell 1.
* prefer -aid 129 to options in ~/.mplayer/mencoder.conf or --ma "-alang fr"
* To check / demux a video on your PC, you can try dpgshow included  in the 
 doc of this rpm package (or write a better one, "dd ibs=1" is slow) 


Bugs / Todo:
- Fix youtube video encoding
- Fix a/v sync with some source codecs
- Add an other setting (-vhq ?) using dia=4:pre_dia=4 and higher bitrates
- Support ogg/vorbis audio in DPG3 videos
